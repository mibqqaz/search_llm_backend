Python is a versatile programming language with a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. [citation:3] It is often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. [citation:1] Python's ease of use and extensive libraries make it accessible to both beginners and experienced programmers. [citation:1] Additionally, using a tuple with a dictionary prevents the dictionary's keys from being changed to items with a different hash value, ensuring the dictionary's integrity. [citation:2]
